                <h2>Is it permissible to keep cats in Islam?</h2>
               <p> <b>It is permissible to keep cats in the house</b> , and there is nothing wrong with that because cats are not harmful or najis (impure). </p>
               <p>With regard to cats not being harmful, no one disputes that, rather they are useful because they eat snakes, rats, bugs and other things that may be in the house or yard. </p>

                <h2>Are cats impure in Islam?</h2>
                <p><b> cats not being najis/impure </b>this is known from the hadith of Kabshah bint Ka’b ibn Malik, who said that Abu Qatadah – her husband's father – entered upon her and <b>she poured water for him to do wudu, and a cat came to drink from it,</b> so he tipped the vessel for it to drink. Kabshah said: “He saw me looking at him and said, “Do you find it strange, O daughter of my brother?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “They (cats) are not najis, rather they are of those who go around amongst you.”’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 92; al-Nasai, 68; Abu Dawood, 75; Ibn Majah, 367. classed as sahih by al-Albani. Ibn Hajar narrated in al-Talkhis that al-Bukhari classed it as sahih). </p>

                <h2>Muhammad's favorite cat name</h2>
                <b>Muezza <i>nickname</i></b>
                <p>Many Muslims believe that Muezza (or Muʿizza; Arabic: معزة) was Muhammad's favorite cat</p>
                <p>Muhammad awoke one day to the sounds of the adhan. Preparing to attend prayer, he began to dress himself; however, he soon discovered his cat Muezza sleeping on the sleeve of his prayer robe. Rather than wake her, he used a pair of scissors to cut the sleeve off, leaving the cat undisturbed. He then smiled and gently stroked his beloved cat three times, giving all cats the ability to land squarely on their feet</p>

                <h2>How Abu Hurayrah got his nickname?</h2>
                <p>The great Sahabi Abu Hurayrah (literally “Father of the Kitten”) was so called because he used to love cats and keep them. He became well known by this name and people forgot his real name, until the scholars disputed concerning his real name and there were nearly thirty different opinions as to what it was. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Isti'ab: “The most correct view is that his name was ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr but none of them disputed that he was Abu Hurayrah.” 

                    And Allah knows best.</p>

                <h2>If my pet cat walkes infront of me or sits infront of me while I'm praying what must I do carry on my prayers of or cut off and shoo it away?</h2>
                <p>Prayer is invalidated if one of three things mentioned by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) walks in front of the worshipper. He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Prayer is invalidated by a woman, a donkey or a dog; that may be prevented by something equal in height to the back of a saddle [placed in front of the worshipper as a sutrah or screen].” (Narrated by Muslim, 511). </p>
                <p><b>cats they do not invalidate the prayer</b> even if they pass in front of you, because the basic guideline is that the prayer is valid, and there is no evidence to suggest that cats can invalidate the prayer. </p>
                <p>But the worshipper <b>should try hard to ensure that nothing passes in front of him.</b> ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb narrated from his father that his grandfather said: “We stopped with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Thaniyyat Adhaakhir and the time for prayer came, so he prayed facing a wall which lay in the direction of the qiblah, and we were behind him. A lamb came and tried to pass in front of him and he kept pushing it back until its belly was pushed up against the wall, then it passed behind him.” (narrated by Abu Dawood, 708; al-Albaani said in Saheeh Abi Dawood, it is hasan saheeh, 652). </p>
