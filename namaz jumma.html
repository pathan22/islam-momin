                <b>What is Jummah Prayer ?</b>
                <p>Jummah (Friday) prayer is a congregational prayer which is performed by Muslims on every Friday. Jummah(Friday) prayer is followed by a sermon (khutbah) from an imam.</p>
               
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Virtues of Jummah Prayer:-</h2>

                <p>Many hadiths have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which explain the virtues of Jumu`ah prayer. For example: 
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Muslim (233)</b> narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The five daily prayers, and from one Jumu`ah to the next, are an expiation for whatever sins come in between, so long as one does not commit any major sin.” </p>
                  <p>Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does ghusl then comes to Jumu`ah, and prays as much as Allah decrees for him, then listens attentively until the khutbah (Friday Sermon ) is over, then prays with him (the imam), will be forgiven for (his sins) between that and the next Jumu`ah and three more days.”<b> Narrated by Muslim, 857 </b></p>
                  <p><b>Al-Nawawi said:</b> 

                    “The scholars said that what is meant by his being forgiven between the two Jumu`ahs and three more days is that a good deed is worth ten like it, so he will be<b> rewarded with ten hasanahs for each of the good deeds that he did on Friday .</b>
                     Some of our companions said: what is meant by what is between the two Jumu`ahs is from the Jumu`ah prayer and the khutbah until the same time on the following Friday , so that it will be seven days, no more and no less, then three days are added making ten in all.” </p>
                     <p>Coming early to Jumu`ah brings a great reward. </p>
                     <p><b>Al-Bukhari (814) and Muslim (850)</b> narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does ghusl on Friday like ghusl for major ritual impurity, then goes to the prayer (in the first hour, i.e., early), it is as if he sacrificed a camel. Whoever goes in the second hour, it is as if he sacrificed a cow; whoever goes in the third hour, it is as if he sacrificed a horned ram; whoever goes in the fourth hour, it is as if he sacrificed a hen; and whoever goes in the fifth hour it is as if he offered an egg. When the imam comes out, the angels come to listen to the khutbah.” </p>
                     <p> *If a person walks to Jumu`ah prayer, for every step he will have the reward of fasting and praying qiyam for one year. </p>

                <h2>Recommended acts of Worship:-</h2>
               <h3>1.Making a lot of du’aa’</h3>
               <p>On this day there is a time when a person’s Lord will answer his du’a – by Allah’s leave. </p>

                <p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned Friday and said: “On this day there is a time when no Muslim stands and prays, asking Allah for something, but Allah will grant him it” – and he gestured with his hands to indicate how short that time is.<b> (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 893; Muslim, 852)</b></p>
                <h3>2. Reading Surat al-Kahf</h3>
                <p>It was narrated from Abu Sa’id al-Khduri that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads Surat al-Kahf on Friday, he will be illuminated with light between the two Fridays.” <b>(Narrated by al-Hakim; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib, 836)</b></p>
                <h3>3. Sending a lot of blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). </h3>
                <p>It was narrated from Aws ibn Aws that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your days is Friday. On that day Adam (peace be upon him) was created; on that day he died; on that day the Trumpet will be blown; and on that day all of creation will swoon. So send a great deal of blessings upon me (i.e. on Friday), for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, how will our blessings upon you be shown to you when you have turned to dust?” He said, “Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets.” <b>Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1047; classed as sahih by Ibn al-Qayyim in his comments on Sunan Abi Dawud, 4/273; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 925.</b> </p>
