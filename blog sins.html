                <b>How do I know that Allah has forgiven my sins?</b>
                <p><b>Question:</b>
                    How will I know that Allah has forgiven my sins for which I had asked forgiveness?</p>
                    <b>Answer</b><p>Indeed, Allah loves those who turn to him in sincere repentance:</p>
                    <p>The following are some signs that Allah has accepted and forgiven a person:</p>
                    <li> That the person’s condition will become better than it was before</li>
                    <li> That he/she will continue to fear the sin and its consequences</li>
                    <li> That he/she will purify his/her heart and feel regret </li>
                    <li> The he/she will feel ashamed and humbled in front of Alla</li>

                <h2>4 signs which confirm that Allah ﷻ has forgiven us:</h2>
<p>Here are 4 signs which confirm that Allah ﷻ has forgiven us.</p>
                <p> <b>Positive Change:</b>
                    When Allah ﷻ forgives, he turns the heart of the sinner. Such a person feels happy upon leaving his bad habits and experiences a positive change within. When one starts to feel a positive change, it is one of the signs that Allah has forgiven him.
                  <br>
                  <b>Giving up the sins:</b>
                  It is one of the preconditions to ask for forgiveness that you decide in your heart to give up that sin. If you don’t intend to give up that particular sin, it means you are not repenting upon it and hence no forgiveness.
                  <br>
                <p>One of the major signs of forgiveness is that a person gives up on the sins.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>What are the Conditions of sincere repentance:</h2>
               <li>You should give up the sin.</li>
               <li>You should regret having done it.</li>
               <li>You should resolve never to go back to it.</li>

               <p>If one of these three is missing, then your repentance is not sincere. If the sin has to do with the rights of another person, then there are four conditions: the three mentioned above and restoring the rights of that person. If it is money or property, etc. it must be returned to him; if it had to do with slandering him etc.,</p>
               <p>then you should allow him to insult you in return or ask for his forgiveness; if it had to do with backbiting about him, then you have to ask for his pardon. It is essential to repent from all sins; if a person repents from some, his repentance from the sins from which he repented is valid – according to the scholars who follow the right path – but he must still repent from the rest as well. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>What Quran says about Allah’s Forgiveness:</h2>
               <p>There are many verses in the Quran which tells us how merciful Allah is, Indeed He is Ar-Rahman the most merciful.</p>
               <p>“Say: O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
                <b>[al-Zumar 39:53]</b></p>
                <p>“And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.”<b>[al-Noor 24:31] </b></p>
                <p>“O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance!”

                   <b> [al-Tahreem 66:8]</b></p>
                   <p>“Will they not turn with repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness? For Allah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.”

                   <b> [al-Maa'idah 5:74]</b></p>
