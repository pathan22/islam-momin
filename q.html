Every time they are fed with fruits there-from, they say: “Why, this is what we were fed with before,” for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein (for ever).”</p>

          <div class="accordion-body">
              Ans:<strong>Islam prohibits a woman from having more than one husband:</strong>
              <li>Man is more polygamous by nature as compared to a woman.</li>
              <li>Biologically, it is easier for a man to perform his duties as a husband despite having several wives. A woman, in a similar position, having several husbands, will not find it possible to perform her duties as a wife.</li>
              <li> A woman who has more than one husband will have several sexual partners at the same time and has a high chance of acquiring venereal or sexually transmitted diseases which can also be transmitted back to her husband even if all of them have no extra-marital sex. This is less likely in a man having more than one sexual partner, and none of them having extra-marital sex.</li>

          <div class="accordion-body">
              Ans:<strong>The reasons why Islam permits a man to marry more than one wife:</strong>
              <li>Taqwa (a God fearing attitude).</li>
              <li>Preservation of vigour.</li>
              <li> Even in case of disagreement divorce is avoided.</li>
              <li> A wife may be effete- incapable of producing offspring.</li>
              <li> In some countries, or families, there is a surplus of female children.</li>
              <li>A woman does not generally remain fertile after fifty years of age while a man is fertile even at ninety years of age.</li>
              <li>Adultery is very common in those countries where it is not allowed to marry more than one wife.</li>
              <strong>In Islam, Man is not allowed to marry more than four wives.</strong>

           Q:Why did Prophet Muhammad have 11 wives despite Islam allowing only 4?

        </h2>
        <div id="12" class="accordion-collapse collapse " data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
          <div class="accordion-body">
              Ans:<strong>The Divine Decree in the Glorious Quran exempted Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) from the same law that is decreed for his Ummah i.e., marry up to four wives, if one can afford.</strong>
              <p>Allah Ta’ala Says:</p>
              <li>“You (O Muhammad) can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them (your wives), and you may receive whom you will. And whomsoever you desire of those whom you have set aside (her turn temporarily), it is no sin on you (to receive her again), that is better; that they may be comforted and not grieved, and may all be pleased with what you give them. Allah knows what is in your hearts. And Allah is Ever All Knowing, Most Forbearing.”</li>
              <li> He was the messenger for the men of the children of Adam (Alaihis Salam) and was equally messenger for their women. So, it was necessary that some women remain in his company forever and learn different things from him to teach them to the other women. They may preach to their fellow women. That is why Prophet married more women than he had allowed his people.</li>

              <p>According to the Shari?ah, the Qur’aan and Ahaadith, the woman’s place is at home. It is the responsibility of the husband to support his wife and fulfil all her needs. </p>
