                <h2>Janazah namaz</h2>
                <b>What is Janazah Prayer?</b>
                <p>Salat Al-Janazah is a right of the Muslim upon the muslim. It is a way of us to bid farewell to our loved ones and to remind ourselves that we too will follow the same path one day.</p>
                <p>كُلُّ نَفْسٍۢ ذَآئِقَةُ ٱلْمَوْتِ ۗ</p>
                <b>"Every soul will taste Death"
                    21:35</b>
                    <p>The Funeral Prayer in Islam is Fard Kafayah (communal obligation), which basically means if one prays the prayer than all are Bareeuz Zimma [free of the responsiblity]. Otherwise, all those who received news of the death and did not attend the funeral would be considered sinners.</p>
                    <p style="color: white; background-color:black">It was narrated that 'Imran bin Husain said:
                        "The Messenger of Allah said: 'Your brother has died, so get up and pray for him." <b>(Sunan an-Nasa'i 1946)</b></p>
                        <p>There is also a great reward for attending the funeral prayer. The Prophet (peace be upon him) told us the rewards are equal to two huge mountains. So attending the funeral prayer is a time to get easy reward for your own reckoning.</p>
                        <p style="color: white; background-color:black">Narrated Abu Huraira:
<br>
                            That Allah's Messenger (p.b.u.h) said, "Whoever attends the funeral procession till he offers the funeral prayer for it, will get a reward equal to <b>one Qirat</b>, and whoever accompanies it till burial, will get a reward equal to <b>two Qirats</b>." It was asked, "What are two Qirats?" He replied, <b>"Like two huge mountains.</b>"
                            <br>
                           <i> Sahih al-Bukhari 1325</i></p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>How to pray Salat al-Janazah?</h2>

                <p>The prayer over the deceased person takes the following form:</p>
                <li>Make sure you have made Wu’du and face the qiblah just like any other prayer.</li>
                <li>The Janazah prayer has neither Adhaan nor lqamah.</li>
                <li>The body of the deceased should already be washed and shrouded and placed in front of the congregation.</li>
                <li>The deceased is laid down on the ground with the face directed towards the Ka’ba.</li>
                <li>Where the deceased is a male, the Imam would stand facing towards the head of the dead body.</li>
                <li>If the deceased is a woman, the Imam would stand facing the middle part of the dead body. Meanwhile, the congregation would be standing behind him in rows.</li>
                <li>The Janazah prayer is performed with one standing only and has neither bows (Rukuus) nor prostration (Sujuuds).</li>
                <li>Stand shoulder to shoulder, feet to feet to the person either side of you as prescribed in the sunnah.</li>
     
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Rules Of Janazah</h2>

                <li>Some people pray while wearing shoes and many people pray Janazah while standing on the shoes. If one prays while wearing the shoes then it is necessary that the shoes and the earth underneath be pure and if one stands on the shoes then it is necessary that the shoes be pure.</li>
                <li>There is more ihtiyat (care) that one does not pray while standing on the shoes. Stand on the earth, if you want you can stand upon your handkerchief.</li>
                <li>It is necessary for the body of the deceased to be present; the Janazah of the absent is not permissible.</li>
                <li>It is mustahabb that the Imam stands in front of the chest of the deceased.</li>

                        </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Virtues Of Attending The Janazah Prayer</h2>
               <p>The virtues of the funeral prayer are many. Besides seeking forgiveness for the deceased the funeral prayer is also a time for self reflection. Attending the funeral prayer and graves of the deceased softens the heart and humbles you.</p>
               <p>It is a reminder that you will also die one day and stand in front of your Lord. So make sure to use this time to re-analyze your own life and deeds. And what you will take to the grave with you.</p>
               <p style="color: white; background-color:black">Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) reported:
<br>
                The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said <b>“Visit the graves, for that makes you mindful of death”.</b>
             <br>   
                Sahih Muslim 976</p>
                <p style="color: white; background-color:black">It was narrated that Al-Bara’ said:
<br>
                    “We were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at a funeral, and he sat at the edge of the grave weeping, until the ground became wet. Then he said:<b> ‘O my brothers, prepare yourselves for something like this.’”</b>
